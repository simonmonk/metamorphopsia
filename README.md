# metamorphopsia.py

An open tool for assessing Metamorphopsia caused by an epiretinal membrane (ERM)

There are two versions of this program here. A Python version and an HRML5 and Javascript version, which you can also find online https://monkmakes.com/metamorphopsia/.

I have an ERM in my right eye, and at the end of a recent examination, I was given an Amsler chart to take home, to use for self assessment of the amount of distortion. With the the words *if it gets worse, come back and see us. If not, see you in a year*.

The *Amsler Recording Chart*, is just an A5 sheet of paper with a 5mm pitch grid printed on it and a dot in the middle. When you look at it with one eye (staring at the dot) you see distortion in the grid. For me, the horizontal lines bend near the middle.

On the way home from the opticians, I started thinking about how this self-assessment could be done in a more quantitative manner.

The result of this is a prototype software tool that I can use to record my metamorphopsia. 


# Caveat

I have zero optometry training. I can barely spell it. So please, please, please **DO NOT RELY ON THIS TOOL**. Go and see a professional.

I am very aware that this works for me, as my distortions are only along horizontal lines. And essentially I have a single distortion 'bump', that extends to several lines above and below the dot. And, imaging the distortion may be on different axes for different people.

I don't know how useful this tool will be for someone with a *diagonal* distortion.

I'd love to enter into a discussion on this with an optometrist, and welcome pull requests for improvements. If you have found the tool useful, please send me a message via github.
